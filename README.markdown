This tool is ping for multicast. It both sends and receives multicast packets on the supplied address/port. You can test multicast connectivity between two computers by running the tool on each and seeing if both display connections.

A pre-built version is included at the root as "Multicast Ping App.zip".

## System Requirements

* The app runs on Intel/PPC 10.4.11+.
* The project was built in Xcode/Interface Builder 3.2.1.
